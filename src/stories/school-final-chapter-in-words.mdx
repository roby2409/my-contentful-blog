## Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I hope you are all well. 2019 marked the end of my academic journey, facing real life challenges ðŸ˜¢.

## *What have I done while I was in college and after graduating from college?*
In my first semester of college, I focused on building skills and exploring the world of IT, which I had studied autodidactically since school, joining a community on campus to explore Basic Programming. My favorite turned out to be Programming. In semesters 3 and 4, I started to become more confident in choosing what technology I wanted to pursue, I chose the Flutter framework and CodeIgniter, then grew to choose other technologies.

The second year of my college life was full of challenges and joys in developing my skills as a software developer. I began to explore various technologies and frameworks, including Flutter, CodeIgniter, and many more. Every day, I learned something new and challenged myself to become better at programming.

In my third year, I delved deeper into programming by expanding my understanding of various related concepts and technologies. I was actively involved in various projects and competitions, which helped me sharpen my programming skills. I also learned about project management and collaborated with teams to achieve common goals.

After graduating from college, I decided to focus on software development as my career. I started looking for jobs in the technology industry and successfully landed a position as a software developer at a leading company. Here, I continued to learn and grow, facing new challenges every day and continually improving my skills.

I am grateful for the journey I have been on and am excited to move forward in my career as a software developer. I believe that with dedication and hard work, I will continue to grow and achieve great things in this industry. Thank you for all your support!

## _What's next for me?_

Well, I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities it holds. As a software developer, I am constantly learning and evolving, keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in the industry. I aspire to work on challenging projects that not only expand my skills but also make a positive impact on society.

I am also keen on exploring new domains within software development, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. These fields fascinate me, and I believe they hold the key to solving some of the world's most pressing issues.

Furthermore, I am committed to giving back to the community by sharing my knowledge and experiences with aspiring developers. I want to mentor and inspire others to pursue a career in technology and help them achieve their goals.

Overall, I am optimistic about what lies ahead and look forward to embracing new opportunities and challenges. I believe that with passion, perseverance, and a willingness to learn, I can achieve anything I set my mind to in the world of software development.

## _Hope for us all_

As I look ahead, I am filled with hope for the future. I believe that technology has the power to transform lives and make the world a better place. I am excited to be a part of this journey and contribute in meaningful ways.

I hope to see a world where technology is used to bridge gaps and bring people together. A world where access to education, healthcare, and opportunities is not limited by geographical boundaries or socioeconomic status. I envision a future where innovation is driven by compassion and a desire to create a more equitable and sustainable world for all.

In conclusion, I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. I am excited about the future and the possibilities it holds. As I continue on my journey as a software developer, I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world around me. I believe that by working together, we can create a better future for us all.
