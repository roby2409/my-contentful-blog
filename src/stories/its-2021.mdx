The year 2024 is coming, and it's a perfect time to reflect on the achievements and experiences of the past year. As I prepare to welcome 2024, I want to take a moment to summarize what I have accomplished in 2023 and set new targets for the upcoming year.

## Side Projects

Throughout 2023, I worked on various side projects that allowed me to explore new technologies and expand my skillset. One of the most rewarding projects was building a web application for a company based in Singapore, which helped them streamline their operations and reach a wider audience. I also collaborated with a team from the United States on a project involving React.js, Next.js, and Nuxt.js, which gave me valuable experience working with international teams and mastering these technologies.

### Music

Music has always been a passion of mine, and in 2023, I had the opportunity to further pursue this passion. I am part of a reggae band in Indonesia, where we create and perform music that resonates with our audience. Being part of this band has not only allowed me to express myself creatively but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and collaboration.

## Career

2023 was also a year of significant growth in my career. I mastered Flutter and Swift native development and deepened my knowledge in web development, focusing on Nuxt.js, Next.js, and React.js. I also completed several certification courses in cloud computing and machine learning, further enhancing my expertise in these areas.

## Targets for 2024

As I look ahead to 2024, I have set several targets for myself to continue growing personally and professionally. Some of my goals for the upcoming year include:

- Mastering advanced concepts in web development with a focus on Nuxt.js, Next.js, and React.js
- Building and launching my own web applications to gain practical experience
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay updated with industry trends
- Contributing to open-source projects to give back to the community and enhance my skills
- Networking with professionals in the industry to expand my knowledge and opportunities

I am excited about the opportunities that 2024 will bring and look forward to pushing myself to new heights. Here's to a successful and fulfilling year ahead!
